This is Project 1.03 - Path Finding. This assignment we focus on creating the weighted map for two types of trainer: "Rival" and "Hiker". Both current and future available trainers will always attempt to path to the PC (Playable Character). Currently I have implemented weighted maps for Rival and Hiker.

Something that should be noted is that the current printing format is using Dr. Shaeffer's formatting, printf("%3d", distance % 100) if it is not INT_MAX and print double space if it is. This causes the output to seem off on certain map locations.

=======================================================================================
This folder will contain a few files, which include: README, Makefile, map.c, map.h, main.c, heap.c, heap.h

map.c => the source code in c for the map.
main.c => contains the main method which runs the program.
heap.c => Dr. Sheaffer's heap implementation from Assignment 1.02
Makefile => Contains make function that compiles both map.c and main.c, creating the executable file, and clean, which removes the file.
